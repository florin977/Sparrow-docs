title: Introduction
description: Describing the scope of the docs.
---

This will be documentation for the engine I am currently building, as well as a series of tutorials regarding: getting started with Vulkan, some Rust lessons and lots of different rendering techniques and the maths behind them.
Stick around for the journey!

:::note
This is a **Work-In-Progress** (both the engine and the documentation are, in fact).
Content will be added as I develop the engine and learn more about the subject.
